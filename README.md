Stock Market prediction project using Python with graphs and linear regression.
. Stock Market Prediction

This project analyzes and predicts stock prices of major technology companies using Python.

. Overview
- The project downloads stock data for Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOGL) from 2019 to 2025 using `yfinance`.
- It visualizes stock performance trends using line graphs.
